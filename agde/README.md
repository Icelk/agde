# agde

> A general decentralized sync library supporting text and binary.

`agde` is a library implementing the `agde` protocol to handle syncing clients in a network.

It can sync whenever, like Git, but doesn't store a history. This means the storage it uses is much lower. It's also faster, and merging is automatic. This enables real-time cooperation.
